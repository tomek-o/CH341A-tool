## Compiling

This application is built with Turbo C++ Explorer 2006 (free version of BDS 2006, aka C++ Builder).
Use CH341A_tool_all.bdsgroup project group file to build all included projects, CH341A_tool_exe.bdsgroup can be used later to build/rebuild only the main project.

Note: application requires "CH341PAR" driver installed (either included here as CH341PAR.zip or available from [wch-ic.com](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341PAR_EXE.html).
If you have previously used CH341A for EEPROM/FLASH programming, you most likely already have it installed.
